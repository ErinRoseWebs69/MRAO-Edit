# MRAO-Edit
A simple GUI for creating MRAO maps for certain PBR workflows

If there are any bugs, feel free to open an issue on it! A console variant will be supplied if you need it.

To use, simply drag-and-drop Metallic, Roughness, and AO maps onto the `?!` icons. Alternatively, use `Open File`. Then under settings, choose your export path and the name of the outputted file, and press `Export MRAO Map`!
